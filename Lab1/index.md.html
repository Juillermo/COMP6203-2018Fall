# Designing a Negotiation Party


![Figure [party]: Organizing a party involves choosing music, food, drinks, catering, etc.](party.jpg width="300px")

1. Imagine you have just graduated and plan to throw a nice party for that occasion.
2. The problem is that you do not want to organize everything yourself. 
3. Fortunately, a friend of yours has also graduated and wants to throw a party as well. 
4. You decide to organize the party together, however you have different preferences. You will now have to make joint decisions about what the party will look like; that is, you will have to _negotiate_. 

Being a computer science student, you want to use your skills to make a negotiating party so the party is as close to _your preferences_ as possible.

To approach this _negotiation problem_, to be a good negotiator, you may consider:  

* Orienting yourself towards a win-win approach.
* Planing and having a concrete strategy.
* Determining which offers you will never accept.
* Creating options for mutual gain.
* Taking the preferences of your opponent into account
* Generating a variety of possibilities before deciding what to do.
* Paying a lot of attention to the flow of negotiation.

## Introduction

To approach this problem from a computer science perspective, in the field of *Automated Negotiation*, this problem is modelled in various ways. To give a brief introduction to these models, assume that there are: 

* **A set of agents** is the participants of negotiation.
	* e.g. _negotiating parties_, _humans_ or _software agents_
* **A domain** is the context the agents are negotiating in.
	* e.g. _example above: organizing parties_, negotiating a business deal_, _smart grids, negotiating the electric prices_
* **Preference profiles** a set of profiles, that captures individuals preferences
    * e.g. If the domain is _party_, assume that Agent A prefers *Pizza* over *Hamburger* for **Food**. Agent B prefers *Hamburger* over *Pizza*.   
* **A deadline** when the negotiation halts. 
	* e.g. 1 hour, 2000 rounds (will be explained later)
* **A protocol** how the negotiation is going to take place.
	* e.g. [Round-robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament) fashion, a mediator based
